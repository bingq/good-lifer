    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last Updated: January 2, 2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Good Lifer is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection and Storage</h2>
    <p>Good Lifer is designed with privacy as a core principle. <strong>All data is stored locally on your device</strong> using the device's local storage system. This means:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your achievements, journal entries, and categories are stored only on your device</li>
        <li>No data is transmitted to external servers</li>
        <li>No data is shared with third parties</li>
        <li>No data is collected by us or any analytics services</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Types of Data Stored Locally</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Achievements</strong>: Your logged achievements including category, name, quantity, unit, notes, and timestamps</li>
        <li><strong>Tree Hole Entries</strong>: Your private journal entries and their timestamps</li>
        <li><strong>Categories</strong>: Your achievement categories and their configurations</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share, sell, or transmit your data to anyone. Your data remains on your device and is never sent to external servers.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Good Lifer does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. The app operates completely offline and does not require an internet connection.</p>

    <h2>Data Export and Deletion</h2>
    <p>You can export your data at any time through the Settings screen. You can also delete all your data using the "Clear All Data" option in Settings. This action is permanent and cannot be undone.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Good Lifer is suitable for users of all ages. Since we do not collect any information, no personal data from children is gathered.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control. You can delete or export your data at any time. Uninstalling the app removes all local data.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected by updating the "Last Updated" date above.</p>
